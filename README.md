# Homework02HTML-CSS

## Description
This repository is where i've uploaded my first homework assignment. The source code was originally pulled from Github, where several key changes were made. The first was to remove all general 'div'elements, and replace with semantic HTML elements, without changing the general layout, or appearance of the webpage. Once completed, the linked CSS file was edited, so that all selectors matched the elements located in the index.html directory. This included following the **Scout Rule**. I consolidated CSS selectors that had identical properties, making the document easier to read. The last thing you will notice are comments outlining what each HTML element does in the pages layout, and each CSS selectors purpose. 

I struggled quite a bit with pushing the changes I made from my local repo to to remote repo. I learned that I need to make the initialize the repository, via gitbash, into the same directory that i have my work in. This allows me to push and pull from Github. It's all about staying organized, and when working through the command line, knowing which folder has your edited documents in it. Also, I realized that while navigating through folders in Gitbash, you can move through more than one foler at a time by pressing 'tab', before hitting énter'. This makes the command line far less messy. An example: cd Coding/Bootcamp/Homework/Homework02/homework02HTML-CSS, then hit énter' and you will go to the last folder in the string.

## Usage
I used the text editor Visual Studio Code to edit the HTML and CSS files. Then, I added the edited files to my local repository, committing the changes with unique specific comments, pulled all remote repository files and pushed the remaining changes to this remote repository. This image shows the completed, edited documents.
