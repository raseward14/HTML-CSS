# Homework02HTML-CSS

## Description
This repository is where i've uploaded my first homework assignment. The source code was originally pulled from Github, where several key changes were made. The first was to remove all general 'div'elements, and replace with semantic HTML elements, without changing the general layout, or appearance of the webpage. Once completed, the linked CSS file was edited, so that all selectors matched the elements located in the index.html directory. This included following the **Scout Rule**. I consolidated CSS selectors that had identical properties, making the document easier to read. The last thing you will notice are comments outlining what each HTML element does in the pages layout, and each CSS selectors purpose.
